# BashProject
This is the bash project
Based on predetermined criteria, this script splits a text file into numerous text files. The script divides the input text into words using regular expressions and generates separate files for each word. It also handles invalid arguments and has a help option (-h) for usage guidance. With the -s option, this script enables you to define a specific word separator. After processing the input text file, it creates separate text files in the output_files directory for each word. When the -h option is provided, it also handles invalid arguments and displays a help message.
